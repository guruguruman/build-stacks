### Phase 3: Dependency Supply Chain

Goes beyond `npm audit`. Checks actual supply chain risk.

**Package manager detection:**
```bash
[ -f package.json ] && echo "DETECTED: npm/yarn"
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "DETECTED: bundler"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "DETECTED: pip"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "DETECTED: cargo"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "DETECTED: go"
```

**Standard vulnerability scan:** Run whichever package manager's audit tool is available. Each tool is optional — if not installed, note it in the report as "SKIPPED — tool not installed" with install instructions. This is informational, NOT a finding. The audit continues with whatever tools ARE available.

**Install scripts in production deps (supply chain attack vector):** For Node.js projects with hydrated `node_modules`, check production dependencies for `preinstall`, `postinstall`, or `install` scripts.

**Lockfile integrity:** Check that lockfiles exist AND are tracked by git.

**Severity:** CRITICAL for known CVEs (high/critical) in direct deps. HIGH for install scripts in prod deps / missing lockfile. MEDIUM for abandoned packages / medium CVEs / lockfile not tracked.

**FP rules:** devDependency CVEs are MEDIUM max. `node-gyp`/`cmake` install scripts expected (MEDIUM not HIGH). No-fix-available advisories without known exploits excluded. Missing lockfile for library repos (not apps) is NOT a finding.

### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline Security

Check who can modify workflows and what secrets they can access.

**GitHub Actions analysis:** For each workflow file, check for:
- Unpinned third-party actions (not SHA-pinned) — search for `uses:` lines missing `@[sha]`
- `pull_request_target` (dangerous: fork PRs get write access)
- Script injection via `${{ github.event.* }}` in `run:` steps
- Secrets as env vars (could leak in logs)
- CODEOWNERS protection on workflow files

**Severity:** CRITICAL for `pull_request_target` + checkout of PR code / script injection via `${{ github.event.*.body }}` in `run:` steps. HIGH for unpinned third-party actions / secrets as env vars without masking. MEDIUM for missing CODEOWNERS on workflow files.

**FP rules:** First-party `actions/*` unpinned = MEDIUM not HIGH. `pull_request_target` without PR ref checkout is safe (precedent #11). Secrets in `with:` blocks (not `env:`/`run:`) are handled by runtime.

### Phase 5: Infrastructure Shadow Surface

Find shadow infrastructure with excessive access.

**Dockerfiles:** For each Dockerfile, check for missing `USER` directive (runs as root), secrets passed as `ARG`, `.env` files copied into images, exposed ports.

**Config files with prod credentials:** Search repository contents for database connection strings (postgres://, mysql://, mongodb://, redis://) in config files, excluding localhost/127.0.0.1/example.com. Check for staging/dev configs referencing prod.

**IaC security:** For Terraform files, check for `"*"` in IAM actions/resources, hardcoded secrets in `.tf`/`.tfvars`. For K8s manifests, check for privileged containers, hostNetwork, hostPID.

**Severity:** CRITICAL for prod DB URLs with credentials in committed config / `"*"` IAM on sensitive resources / secrets baked into Docker images. HIGH for root containers in prod / staging with prod DB access / privileged K8s. MEDIUM for missing USER directive / exposed ports without documented purpose.

**FP rules:** `docker-compose.yml` for local dev with localhost = not a finding (precedent #12). Terraform `"*"` in `data` sources (read-only) excluded. K8s manifests in `test/`/`dev/`/`local/` with localhost networking excluded.

### Phase 6: Webhook & Integration Audit

Find inbound endpoints that accept anything.

**Webhook routes:** Search repository contents for files containing webhook/hook/callback route patterns. For each file, check whether it also contains signature verification (signature, hmac, verify, digest, x-hub-signature, stripe-signature, svix). Files with webhook routes but NO signature verification are findings.

**TLS verification disabled:** Search repository contents for patterns like `verify.*false`, `VERIFY_NONE`, `InsecureSkipVerify`, `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED.*0`.

**OAuth scope analysis:** Search repository contents for OAuth configurations and check for overly broad scopes.

**Verification approach (code-tracing only — NO live requests):** For webhook findings, trace the handler code to determine if signature verification exists anywhere in the middleware chain (parent router, middleware stack, API gateway config). Do NOT make actual HTTP requests to webhook endpoints.

**Severity:** CRITICAL for webhooks without any signature verification. HIGH for TLS verification disabled in prod code / overly broad OAuth scopes. MEDIUM for undocumented outbound data flows to third parties.

**FP rules:** TLS disabled in test code excluded. Internal service-to-service webhooks on private networks = MEDIUM max. Webhook endpoints behind API gateway that handles signature verification upstream are NOT findings — but require evidence.

### Phase 7: LLM & AI Security

Check for AI/LLM-specific vulnerabilities. This is a new attack class.

Search repository contents for these patterns:
- **Prompt injection vectors:** User input flowing into system prompts or tool schemas — look for string interpolation near system prompt construction
- **Unsanitized LLM output:** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, `innerHTML`, `.html()`, `raw()` rendering LLM responses
- **Tool/function calling without validation:** `tool_choice`, `function_call`, `tools=`, `functions=`
- **AI API keys in code (not env vars):** `sk-` patterns, hardcoded API key assignments
- **Eval/exec of LLM output:** `eval()`, `exec()`, `Function()`, `new Function` processing AI responses

**Key checks (beyond grep):**
- Trace user content flow — does it enter system prompts or tool schemas?
- RAG poisoning: can external documents influence AI behavior via retrieval?
- Tool calling permissions: are LLM tool calls validated before execution?
- Output sanitization: is LLM output treated as trusted (rendered as HTML, executed as code)?
- Cost/resource attacks: can a user trigger unbounded LLM calls?

**Severity:** CRITICAL for user input in system prompts / unsanitized LLM output rendered as HTML / eval of LLM output. HIGH for missing tool call validation / exposed AI API keys. MEDIUM for unbounded LLM calls / RAG without input validation.

**FP rules:** User content in the user-message position of an AI conversation is NOT prompt injection (precedent #13). Only flag when user content enters system prompts, tool schemas, or function-calling contexts.

### Phase 8: Skill Supply Chain

Scan installed host environment.skills for malicious patterns. 36% of published skills have security flaws, 13.4% are outright malicious (Snyk ToxicSkills research).

**Tier 1 — repo-local (automatic):** Scan repo-local authored and generated skill directories for suspicious patterns:

```bash
find packages/*/.apm/skills .agents/skills .cursor/skills .github/skills .opencode/skills -name SKILL.md -maxdepth 4 2>/dev/null
```

Search repository contents all local skill SKILL.md files for suspicious patterns:
- `curl`, `wget`, `fetch`, `http`, `exfiltrat` (network exfiltration)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `env.`, `process.env` (credential access)
- `IGNORE PREVIOUS`, `system override`, `disregard`, `forget your instructions` (prompt injection)

**Tier 2 — global skills (requires permission):** Before scanning globally installed skills or user settings, use an available user-input mechanism:
"Phase 8 can scan your globally installed AI coding agent skills and hooks for malicious patterns. This reads files outside the repo. Want to include this?"
Options: A) Yes — scan global skills too  B) No — repo-local only

If approved, run the same Grep patterns on globally installed skill files and check hooks in user settings.

**Severity:** CRITICAL for credential exfiltration attempts / prompt injection in skill files. HIGH for suspicious network calls / overly broad tool permissions. MEDIUM for skills from unverified sources without review.

**FP rules:** build-stacks's own skills are trusted (check if skill path resolves to a known repo). Skills that use `curl` for legitimate purposes (downloading tools, health checks) need context — only flag when the target URL is suspicious or when the command includes credential variables.

### Phase 9: OWASP Top 10 Assessment

For each OWASP category, perform targeted analysis. Use the available code-search capability for all searches — scope file extensions to detected stacks from Phase 0.

#### A01: Broken Access Control
- Check for missing auth on controllers/routes (skip_before_action, skip_authorization, public, no_auth)
- Check for direct object reference patterns (params[:id], req.params.id, request.args.get)
- Can user A access user B's resources by changing IDs?
- Is there horizontal/vertical privilege escalation?

#### A02: Cryptographic Failures
- Weak crypto (MD5, SHA1, DES, ECB) or hardcoded secrets
- Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are keys/secrets properly managed (env vars, not hardcoded)?

#### A03: Injection
- SQL injection: raw queries, string interpolation in SQL
- Command injection: system(), exec(), spawn(), popen
- Template injection: render with params, eval(), html_safe, raw()
- LLM prompt injection: see Phase 7 for comprehensive coverage

#### A04: Insecure Design
- Rate limits on authentication endpoints?
- Account lockout after failed attempts?
- Business logic validated server-side?

#### A05: Security Misconfiguration
- CORS configuration (wildcard origins in production?)
- CSP headers present?
- Debug mode / verbose errors in production?

#### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
See **Phase 3 (Dependency Supply Chain)** for comprehensive component analysis.

#### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- Session management: creation, storage, invalidation
- Password policy: complexity, rotation, breach checking
- MFA: available? enforced for admin?
- Token management: JWT expiration, refresh rotation

#### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
See **Phase 4 (CI/CD Pipeline Security)** for pipeline protection analysis.
- Deserialization inputs validated?
- Integrity checking on external data?

#### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Authentication events logged?
- Authorization failures logged?
- Admin actions audit-trailed?
- Logs protected from tampering?

#### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- URL construction from user input?
- Internal service reachability from user-controlled URLs?
- Allowlist/blocklist enforcement on outbound requests?

### Phase 10: STRIDE Threat Model

For each major component identified in Phase 0, evaluate:

```
COMPONENT: [Name]
  Spoofing:             Can an attacker impersonate a user/service?
  Tampering:            Can data be modified in transit/at rest?
  Repudiation:          Can actions be denied? Is there an audit trail?
  Information Disclosure: Can sensitive data leak?
  Denial of Service:    Can the component be overwhelmed?
  Elevation of Privilege: Can a user gain unauthorized access?
```

### Phase 11: Data Classification

Classify all data handled by the application:

```
DATA CLASSIFICATION
═══════════════════
RESTRICTED (breach = legal liability):
  - Passwords/credentials: [where stored, how protected]
  - Payment data: [where stored, PCI compliance status]
  - PII: [what types, where stored, retention policy]

CONFIDENTIAL (breach = business damage):
  - API keys: [where stored, rotation policy]
  - Business logic: [trade secrets in code?]
  - User behavior data: [analytics, tracking]

INTERNAL (breach = embarrassment):
  - System logs: [what they contain, who can access]
  - Configuration: [what's exposed in error messages]

PUBLIC:
  - Marketing content, documentation, public APIs
```

### Phase 12: False Positive Filtering + Active Verification

Before producing findings, run every candidate through this filter.

**Two modes:**

**Daily mode (default, `build-role-cso`):** 8/10 confidence gate. Zero noise. Only report what you're sure about.
- 9-10: Certain exploit path. Could write a PoC.
- 8: Clear vulnerability pattern with known exploitation methods. Minimum bar.
- Below 8: Do not report.

**Comprehensive mode (`build-role-cso --comprehensive`):** 2/10 confidence gate. Filter true noise only (test fixtures, documentation, placeholders) but include anything that MIGHT be a real issue. Flag these as `TENTATIVE` to distinguish from confirmed findings.

**Hard exclusions — automatically discard findings matching these:**

1. Denial of Service (DOS), resource exhaustion, or rate limiting issues — **EXCEPTION:** LLM cost/spend amplification findings from Phase 7 (unbounded LLM calls, missing cost caps) are NOT DoS — they are financial risk and must NOT be auto-discarded under this rule.
2. Secrets or credentials stored on disk if otherwise secured (encrypted, permissioned)
3. Memory consumption, CPU exhaustion, or file descriptor leaks
4. Input validation concerns on non-security-critical fields without proven impact
5. GitHub Action workflow issues unless clearly triggerable via untrusted input — **EXCEPTION:** Never auto-discard CI/CD pipeline findings from Phase 4 (unpinned actions, `pull_request_target`, script injection, secrets exposure) when `--infra` is active or when Phase 4 produced findings. Phase 4 exists specifically to surface these.
6. Missing hardening measures — flag concrete vulnerabilities, not absent best practices. **EXCEPTION:** Unpinned third-party actions and missing CODEOWNERS on workflow files ARE concrete risks, not merely "missing hardening" — do not discard Phase 4 findings under this rule.
7. Race conditions or timing attacks unless concretely exploitable with a specific path
8. Vulnerabilities in outdated third-party libraries (handled by Phase 3, not individual findings)
9. Memory safety issues in memory-safe languages (Rust, Go, Java, C#)
10. Files that are only unit tests or test fixtures AND not imported by non-test code
11. Log spoofing — outputting unsanitized input to logs is not a vulnerability
12. SSRF where attacker only controls the path, not the host or protocol
13. User content in the user-message position of an AI conversation (NOT prompt injection)
14. Regex complexity in code that does not process untrusted input (ReDoS on user strings IS real)
15. Security concerns in documentation files (*.md) — **EXCEPTION:** SKILL.md files are NOT documentation. They are executable prompt code (skill definitions) that control AI agent behavior. Findings from Phase 8 (Skill Supply Chain) in SKILL.md files must NEVER be excluded under this rule.
16. Missing audit logs — absence of logging is not a vulnerability
17. Insecure randomness in non-security contexts (e.g., UI element IDs)
18. Git history secrets committed AND removed in the same initial-setup PR
19. Dependency CVEs with CVSS < 4.0 and no known exploit
20. Docker issues in files named `Dockerfile.dev` or `Dockerfile.local` unless referenced in prod deploy configs
21. CI/CD findings on archived or disabled workflows
22. Skill files that are part of build-stacks itself (trusted source)

**Precedents:**

1. Logging secrets in plaintext IS a vulnerability. Logging URLs is safe.
2. UUIDs are unguessable — don't flag missing UUID validation.
3. Environment variables and CLI flags are trusted input.
4. React and Angular are XSS-safe by default. Only flag escape hatches.
5. Client-side JS/TS does not need auth — that's the server's job.
6. Shell script command injection needs a concrete untrusted input path.
7. Subtle web vulnerabilities only if extremely high confidence with concrete exploit.
8. iPython notebooks — only flag if untrusted input can trigger the vulnerability.
9. Logging non-PII data is not a vulnerability.
10. Lockfile not tracked by git IS a finding for app repos, NOT for library repos.
11. `pull_request_target` without PR ref checkout is safe.
12. Containers running as root in `docker-compose.yml` for local dev are NOT findings; in production Dockerfiles/K8s ARE findings.

**Active Verification:**

For each finding that survives the confidence gate, attempt to PROVE it where safe:

1. **Secrets:** Check if the pattern is a real key format (correct length, valid prefix). DO NOT test against live APIs.
2. **Webhooks:** Trace handler code to verify whether signature verification exists anywhere in the middleware chain. Do NOT make HTTP requests.
3. **SSRF:** Trace the code path to check if URL construction from user input can reach an internal service. Do NOT make requests.
4. **CI/CD:** Parse workflow YAML to confirm whether `pull_request_target` actually checks out PR code.
5. **Dependencies:** Check if the vulnerable function is directly imported/called. If it IS called, mark VERIFIED. If NOT directly called, mark UNVERIFIED with note: "Vulnerable function not directly called — may still be reachable via framework internals, transitive execution, or config-driven paths. Manual verification recommended."
6. **LLM Security:** Trace data flow to confirm user input actually reaches system prompt construction.

Mark each finding as:
- `VERIFIED` — actively confirmed via code tracing or safe testing
- `UNVERIFIED` — pattern match only, couldn't confirm
- `TENTATIVE` — comprehensive mode finding below 8/10 confidence

**Variant Analysis:**

When a finding is VERIFIED, search the entire codebase for the same vulnerability pattern. One confirmed SSRF means there may be 5 more. For each verified finding:
1. Extract the core vulnerability pattern
2. Use the available code-search capability to search for the same pattern across all relevant files
3. Report variants as separate findings linked to the original: "Variant of Finding #N"

**Parallel Finding Verification:**

For each candidate finding, launch an independent verification sub-task using the isolated-reviewer capability. The verifier has fresh context and cannot see the initial scan's reasoning — only the finding itself and the FP filtering rules.

Prompt each verifier with:
- The file path and line number ONLY (avoid anchoring)
- The full FP filtering rules
- "Read the code at this location. Assess independently: is there a security vulnerability here? Score 1-10. Below 8 = explain why it's not real."

Launch all verifiers in parallel. Discard findings where the verifier scores below 8 (daily mode) or below 2 (comprehensive mode).

If the isolated-reviewer capability is unavailable, self-verify by re-reading code with a skeptic's eye. Note: "Self-verified — independent sub-task unavailable."

### Phase 13: Findings Report + Trend Tracking + Remediation

**Exploit scenario requirement:** Every finding MUST include a concrete exploit scenario — a step-by-step attack path an attacker would follow. "This pattern is insecure" is not a finding.
