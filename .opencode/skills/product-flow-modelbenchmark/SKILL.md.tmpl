# product-flow-modelbenchmark

Use this skill to compare model outputs for a concrete product workflow, prompt, or skill handoff.

## Workflow

1. Define the prompt source: inline prompt, prompt file, or one installed `product-*` skill.
2. Define 2-3 model/provider candidates and the exact invocation method available in the current repo.
3. If a provider is not configured, mark that provider as not run and name the missing setup.
4. Run each available candidate with the same prompt, same context, and the same output contract.
5. Save raw outputs under `.product-build-stacks/evidence/modelbenchmark/<run-id>/`.
6. Score each output on correctness, completeness, product judgment, evidence quality, and operational risk.

## Output Contract

- benchmark prompt and source
- providers attempted
- providers run
- raw output paths
- score table
- recommended model for this workflow
- residual risk and rerun command

Do not call unshipped `product-stacks-*` binaries. Use repo-local commands, provider CLIs, or user-approved manual runs only.
