# product-source-models

Use this skill to prepare model benchmark inputs before `product-flow-modelbenchmark`.

## Workflow

1. Capture the prompt source and normalize it into `.product-build-stacks/evidence/modelbenchmark/<run-id>/prompt.md`.
2. Capture provider setup status without printing secrets.
3. Capture model names, temperature or equivalent sampling settings, and any cost limits.
4. Prepare an evaluation rubric with correctness, completeness, product judgment, evidence quality, and operational risk.
5. Hand off the run directory and provider matrix to `product-flow-modelbenchmark`.

## Output Contract

- prompt path
- provider matrix
- redaction note
- rubric path
- next handoff
