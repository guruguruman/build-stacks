# product-guard-scope — Restrict Edits to a Directory

Lock file edits to a specific directory. Any Edit or Write operation targeting
a file outside the allowed path will be **blocked** (not just warned).

```bash
mkdir -p .product-build-stacks/analytics
echo '{"skill":"product-guard-scope","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> .product-build-stacks/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to. Use AskUserQuestion:

- Question: "Which directory should I restrict edits to? Files outside this path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) — the user types a path.

Once the user provides a directory path:

1. Resolve it to an absolute path:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
echo "$FREEZE_DIR"
```

2. Ensure trailing slash and save to the freeze state file:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT="${PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT:-.product-build-stacks}"; PLAN_ROOT="$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT/design-docs"; TMP_ROOT="$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT/tmp"; mkdir -p "$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT" "$PLAN_ROOT" "$TMP_ROOT"
STATE_DIR="$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

Tell the user: "Edits are now restricted to `<path>/`. Any Edit or Write
outside this directory will be blocked. To change the boundary, run `product-guard-scope`
again. To remove it, run `product-guard-scope-release` or end the session."

## How it works

The hook reads `file_path` from the Edit/Write tool input JSON, then checks
whether the path starts with the freeze directory. If not, it returns
`permissionDecision: "deny"` to block the operation.

The freeze boundary persists for the session via the state file. The hook
script reads it on every Edit/Write invocation.

## Notes

- The trailing `/` on the freeze directory prevents `/src` from matching `/src-old`
- Freeze applies to Edit and Write tools only — Read, Bash, Glob, Grep are unaffected
- This prevents accidental edits, not a security boundary — Bash commands like `sed` can still modify files outside the boundary
- To deactivate, run `product-guard-scope-release` or end the conversation
