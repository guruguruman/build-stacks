# product-guard-scope-release — Clear Freeze Boundary

Remove the edit restriction set by `product-guard-scope`, allowing edits to all directories.

```bash
mkdir -p .product-build-stacks/analytics
echo '{"skill":"unfreeze","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> .product-build-stacks/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Clear the boundary

```bash
PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT="${PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT:-.product-build-stacks}"; PLAN_ROOT="$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT/design-docs"; TMP_ROOT="$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT/tmp"; mkdir -p "$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT" "$PLAN_ROOT" "$TMP_ROOT"
STATE_DIR="$PRODUCT_STATE_ROOT"
if [ -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt" ]; then
  PREV=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt")
  rm -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
  echo "Freeze boundary cleared (was: $PREV). Edits are now allowed everywhere."
else
  echo "No freeze boundary was set."
fi
```

Tell the user the result. Note that `product-guard-scope` hooks are still registered for the
session — they will just allow everything since no state file exists. To re-freeze,
run `product-guard-scope` again.
